# Criminal_Evidence_system
1_Overview:
This project offers a reality simulation system designed to simulate the way the
Criminal Evidence Department works to convert the manual system dealt with in the
office into an electronic or automatic system Through their analysis of the initial crime
scene the requirements of this system were taken from interviews with the staff of the
Criminal Evidence Office, The result of interviews with investigators and design
criteria taken through these interviews is that we are able to make a real map of the
crime scene and make a complete conception of the work. Inspired by society's great
need for it, citizens help to preserve and expedite the resolution of their cases. The
Criminal Evidence Office Police helps facilitate and accelerate their work in resolving
cases in effective ways and safeguarding and integrity of data and facilitating access to
them.
